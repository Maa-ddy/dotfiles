compiles and runs the following files:  
	.cpp  
	.c  
	.java  
	.py  
usage:  
place this in your /usr/bin  
compile_and_run filename (without extension)  
compile_and_run will look for a file named "main" or "Main" in the current dir and compiles and runs it.  
  
bonus:  
create a dir named "testS" and make a text file inside it called "test0.txt"  
then running "compile_and_run" will compile and run your main file redirecting that text file as input  
but only if you put a comment (or name a variable) in your code as "codeforces"  
this feature is used to quicly test code on a test file when playing on a cp contest.
